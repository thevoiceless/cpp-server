Instructions and Notes: 
Untar, cd into the directory, and type 'make'
The application uses port 8504, and debug output is enabled by default (wasn't sure if we were supposed to keep it).
Only GET requests for directories, text files, HTML files, and JPEG files are supported.
GET requests for directories return a list of the directory's contents.
